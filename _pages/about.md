I have handed in my masters thesis in Computer Science at TU Berlin in March 2023. Grading will take a few weeks but my supervisor has already confirmed that I will pass and offered me a PhD position at the DOS institute. However, I would rather return to working in industry which I enjoyed a lot during my time as a working student.

For my masters thesis I have developed a tool to recommend logging statements. I have worked as a working student in a cloud-focused DevOps team and got to experience the woes of inconsistent or lacking logging practice firsthand, which motivated me to improve the situation. In this job I gained a lot of practical DevOps experience, especially with the Hadoop ecosystem, as well as agile/Scrum and CI/CD practice. From this job as well as from my master's coursework, which primarily focused on courses from the distributed systems chair, I also have experience with AWS and GCP, and to a lesser extent also Azure. I have also worked with with and set up containerization, virtualization, monitoring and infrastructure as code tools. 

In addition to my technical skills, I am a quick learner and enjoy working in a team environment. I excel at analytic thinking and I am always looking to expand my knowledge and stay up to date with the latest trends in technology. Recently I have taken up prompt engineering as a new hobby.
